# Django-GraphQL
This repository contains a sample Django project that demonstrates the implementation of a GraphQL API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two models: Category and Ingredient. The project uses the Graphene-Django library to create the GraphQL API, providing a modern and efficient way to interact with the database.
